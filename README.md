# Spookshow

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/xchrishawk/spookshow.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/xchrishawk/spookshow)

Spookshow is an object mocking library for the C++ programming language. It is heavily inspired by [Google Mock](https://github.com/google/googlemock/tree/master/googlemock), but aims to be a bit simpler and more flexible.

## Example

An example test case (using the [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest) framework) is available at [examples/main.cpp](examples/main.cpp). Additional documentation is coming soon.
