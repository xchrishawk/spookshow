[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/xchrishawk/spookshow.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/xchrishawk/spookshow)

Spookshow is an object mocking library for the C++ programming language. It is heavily inspired by
[Google Mock](https://github.com/google/googlemock/tree/master/googlemock), but aims to be a bit
simpler and more flexible.
